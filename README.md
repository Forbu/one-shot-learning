#### Références : 
I (strongly) inspire myself from :
https://github.com/loudinthecloud/pytorch-ntm
for the NTM implementation (that I modify to create the one-shot learning framework with Least Recently Used Access feature).

The original paper on one shot learning using the same initial dataset :
